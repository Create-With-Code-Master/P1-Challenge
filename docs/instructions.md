   <details>
    <summary>Hint</summary>
    
    Make the plane go forward.
    
    ```Vector3.back``` makes an object move backwards, use ```Vector3.forward``` to make it go forwards.
    
   </details>

* The plane is going too fast

   <details>
    <summary>Hint</summary>
    
    Slow the plane down to a managable speed.
    
    If you multiply a value by ```Time.deltaTime```, it will change it from 1x/frame to 1x/second.

* The plane is looping

   <details>
    <summary>Hint</summary>
    
    Make the plane climb or dive only if the user presses the up/down arrows
    
    In **PlayerControllerX.cs**, in ```Update()```, the ```verticalInput``` value is assigned, but itâ€™s never actually used in the ```Rotate()``` call.
